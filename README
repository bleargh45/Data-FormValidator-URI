      use Data::FormValidator;
      use Data::FormValidator::URI;

          website => 'http://www.example.com/path/to/some/resource.html',
      }, {
          required      => [qw( website )],
          field_filters => {
              website => FV_uri_filter(default => 'http'),
          },
          constraint_methods => {

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a filter and a constraint method for use with
    "Data::FormValidator", to help make it easier to valid URIs.

METHODS
    FV_uri_filter(%opts)
        Filter method which cleans up the given value as best it can and
        returns something that looks like a URI.

        The filtered URI will be canonicalized, and common typos will be
        corrected.

        Supported options:

        default_scheme
            Default URI scheme to use, if none was provided in the URI

    FV_uri(%opts)
        Constraint method, which ensures that we have a valid URI.

        Supported options:

        schemes
            list-ref of valid schemes
